## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before we begin, make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

You should also create a GitHub repository to store and manage the project's code and documentation. If you are new to GitHub, you can follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) on creating a new repository.

## Setting Up Your Python Environment <a name="setting-up-your-python-environment"></a>

Itâ€™s a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Python project. This helps to manage dependencies efficiently.

#### Creating a Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv chatbot-env

####Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```sh
chatbot-env\Scripts\activate

- On macOS and Linux:

```sh
source chatbot-env/bin/activate

####Installing Required Libraries
- We need to install the OpenAI library to access ChatGPT and Gradio for creating the user interface.

```sh
pip install openai gradio

- Gradio allows you to rapidly create web-based user interfaces for Python models. OpenAI library helps in integrating with GPT models provided by OpenAI.

Acquiring OpenAI API Key <a name="acquiring-openai-api-key"></a>
For interacting with ChatGPT-4, you'll need an API key from OpenAI.

Head to OpenAI and create an account.
Once logged in, navigate to the API section to generate a new API key.
Store the API key securely as it is needed to authenticate the requests to ChatGPT-4.
Writing the Python Script <a name="writing-the-python-script"></a>
Create a Python script, named medical_chatbot.py, and write the code below:
