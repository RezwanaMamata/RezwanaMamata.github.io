<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Hi! I'm Md Al Maruf, a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Ontario Tech University. My research areas are diverse and forward-thinking, encompassing Embedded Systems Software, Machine Learning, Parallel Computing, Safety-Crtical Systems, Cyber-Physical Systems, Cloud/Fog Computing and Over-the-Air (OTA) Software Update.
</p>

<h2>Research Interest and Projects</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by the intersection of software development and advanced technologies. My PhD research has allowed me to delve deep into feature and requirement extraction for software reuse, the implementation of fog computing in over-the-air updates, and the use of model parallelism in machine learning for computational acceleration. I've had the opportunity to work on exciting real-world case studies and have published my findings in leading journals and conferences.
</p>

<h2>Skills and Experiences</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
With a strong background in both software development and data science, I've honed my skills in various programming languages including Python, C/C++, SQL, and Java, and have substantial experience with data analysis tools and libraries such as OpenMP, Visual Studio, Code Blocks, Eclipse/NetBeans, PhpStorm, Ruby Mine, Pycharm, Sci-kit Learn, Keras and TensorFlow. My ability to handle large datasets, perform intricate analysis, and develop efficient software solutions has been crucial to my research and professional development.
</p>

<h2>Contributions to the Fields</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Beyond my academic pursuits, I strive to contribute to the larger tech community. I've made significant contributions to open source projects on GitHub and actively participate in tech forums and discussions. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others, which led me to mentor up-and-coming students in the field of software development and data science.
</p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
As I move toward the completion of my PhD, I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional capacity. I'm interested in roles that will allow me to blend my software development and data science skills, especially those that can benefit from my expertise in embedded systems and machine learning.
</p>

<h2>Let's Connect</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
I love connecting with other professionals in the field, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss my research, potential collaborations, or job opportunities. You can also follow me on LinkedIn and Twitter for updates on my latest projects and research. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and my work. I look forward to the possibility of working together in the future.
